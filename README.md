## Why who installs what
brew for applications, particularly for casks for [precompiled binaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nix/comments/zdcteb/comment/iz2poto/)
brew for languages with version management and package managers that require global state [npm and python global packages don't work](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox/issues/17)
devbox for tools needed on any project like git
