# TODOs

## Upgrade TMUX > 3.4

Currently hard coded to use `3.3a`

This is because search broke as described in [3864](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/3864)

- Cause is commit [43e5e803](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/43e5e80343185e69a1b864fc48095ede0b898180)
- Last working formula version is [defd6d81](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/defd6d81be1be58f137bef2fa2dc389100d0125b/Formula/t/tmux.rb)
- I helped lead to a fix [5b5004e5](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/commit/5b5004e5ac95b858ef2e134c9e056dd05a38d430)

Post upgrade cleanup:

- Delete `~/.config/tmux/tmux.rb`
- Change path to `tmux` in `~/.config/homebrew/Brewfile`
- Remove pinning of `tmux` in `~/.config/yadm/bootstrap`

## Why who installs what
brew for applications, particularly for casks for [precompiled binaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nix/comments/zdcteb/comment/iz2poto/)
brew for languages with version management and package managers that require global state [npm and python global packages don't work](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox/issues/17)
devbox for tools needed on any project like git 
# Optional

## Install Nix

[Doc](https://nixos.org/)

Uses [Determinate Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
